## Welcome to In-Sight Repositories

In-Sight is a hybrid edge/data center computer vision platform for building scalable, high-performance video analytics on Nvidia DeepStream. Our public repositories contain open-source components available in the platform.

## Open-Source Projects

Our organization deeply values the advantages of open-source software and actively contributes to its development. We understand that open source provides numerous benefits, such as transparency, accountability, and a large community of developers to collaborate with.

Contributing to open source allows us to access the knowledge and expertise of others while also giving back to the community. By working together to develop high-quality software, we can ensure that it is accessible and affordable to everyone, regardless of financial resources.

Furthermore, our commitment to open-source demonstrates our dedication to innovation, collaboration, and social responsibility. It allows us to build a strong reputation, attract like-minded customers and employees, and positively impact society as a whole.

* [Savant](https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant): Python computer vision & video analytics framework with batteries included, optimized for Nvidia hardware;
* [PipelineWatchdog](https://github.com/insight-platform/PipelineWatchdog): a watchdog service monitoring the state of the pipeline and restarting stuck components;
