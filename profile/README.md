## Welcome to In-Sight Repositories

In-Sight is a hybrid edge/dc computer vision platform for scalable high-performance video analytics. In-Sight is built on Nvidia DeepStream. Our public repositories provide open-source frameworks used in the platform to everyone.

## Open-Source Projects

Our organization deeply values the advantages of open-source software and actively contributes to its development. We understand that open-source provides numerous benefits, such as transparency, accountability, and a large community of developers to collaborate with.

Contributing to open-source allows us to access the knowledge and expertise of others while also giving back to the community. By working together to develop high-quality software, we can ensure that it is accessible and affordable to everyone, regardless of financial resources.

Furthermore, our commitment to open-source demonstrates our dedication to innovation, collaboration, and social responsibility. It allows us to build a strong reputation, attract like-minded customers and employees, and make a positive impact on society as a whole.
